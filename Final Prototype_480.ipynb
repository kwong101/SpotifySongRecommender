In order for us to implement this recommendation algorithm, we will need to follow a series of steps. First, the user will need to input a list of their liked songs, as well as a list of their disliked songs. The model will be trained based on the audio features of the user’s selected songs, and will then predict whether the user will like a given song or not. In order to implement this training and recommendation algorithm, we will use the Scikit-learn toolkit. This toolkit provides a multitude of algorithms that can be easily integrated into our training model. We will begin by using a Binary Classifier to provide individual song recommendations for each of the five members of our group. It will classify a song based on whether an individual user will like or dislike it.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will be importing each group member's audio features for their liked and disliked songs.  Next, we will create and train a model for each member based on their preferences.  Lastly, we will use these models to predict user preference (like or dislike) on a group of test songs"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MX8iMnR78V5K"},"source":["# Prerequisites"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bYPFJ3tb8ZSV"},"source":["First, we imported all the relevant libraries that we plan to use for our project."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AOdFLPQtdjNZ"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder\n","from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n","\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n","from sklearn.svm import SVR\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessClassifier\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n","\n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import recall_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9tWsGuj_d6JD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606783039317,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":21707,"user":{"displayName":"Kelly Wong","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhCJwWU4b-mcEM2rrSkarXg4FJd5v9Ww2rmCqANHQ=s64","userId":"01913457856105793745"}},"outputId":"c18f621f-3348-46ec-b8f3-0735c87a6c54"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BwhuMLNQ4lJu"},"source":["#Data Set"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"B1WtSeNN4pkH"},"source":["## Data Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c4cO1mW45Q9E"},"source":["In this section, we imported data from our drive that we previously prepared.

In order to implement song classification, we decided to use a Binary Classifier, which labels data with one of two tags. In our project, the two tags represent liking a song or disliking a song. We explored a multitude of binary classifiers, specifically K-Nearest Neighbor, MLP, and Random Forest. The toolkit that was crucial to our implementation of Binary Classification is Scikit-learn, which is Python’s machine learning library. Since Scikit-learn provides various algorithms to use, we were able to train our model with each of the classifiers within Binary Classification to understand which was the best suited for our project. Our investigation from utilizing Scikit-Learn revealed that the Random Forest Classifier was the best method for this task due to its high accuracy rate. Our exploration of Scikit-learn and Binary Classification proved to be very helpful for our overall project. We were successful in implementing these tools and our model accurately predicts liked and disliked songs."]}]}
